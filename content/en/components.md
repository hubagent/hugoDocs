All the nuts and bolts of the npower Design System and how they fit into each other.

The design system is comprised of:

## Foundation

Background colours and styles etc.

## Atoms

Smallest building blocks to make up the other components. Doesn't make sense to make them any smaller.

## Molecules

More complex components consisting of atoms and other molecules.

## Organisms

The most complex of components. How do you know if something is an molecule or an organism? It's an organism if it only ever appears in a view once - like a header, for example.
