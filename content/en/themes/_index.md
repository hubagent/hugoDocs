## Buttons: General

There are four button atoms within the npower Design System. These are "Primary", "Secondary", "Log in" and "Register". Unusually, they all share the same basic properties, so we've created one Sketch Measure file to outline those properties, using a grey button purely for illustration (there is no grey button).
